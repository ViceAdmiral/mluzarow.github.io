            About Me
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an electrical engineering graduate from Purdue
            University. I've worked in electronics labs for a couple years, doing everything
            from initial schematic design, microcontroller programming and debugging, to project
            packaging design, and team management (the hardest part by far).
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the prior is my official academic achievement,
            I had done a lot of aside work as well, as can be evidenced by the existence of this
            very website. Most of those projects were just ideas that popped up on day and the
            work quickly followed.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also done quite a bit of volunteer work regarding
            teaching and general academic work. I used to do simple tutoring in after school
            programs for children 5th to 8th grade which later evolved into having the chance
            to teach my own IT related course (for a slightly older audience, but all the same).

            About The Site
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entire site is something I had wanted for quite a
            while. I wanted, among other things, a place to easily organize my projects and ideas.
            "But one could simply start a blog," you say with self assured gusto. Well, yes; that
            is true. I previously had a Blogger blog that I would fill with tutorials and other
            academic notes. However, it was lacking; it did not allow you to scripting and design
            freedom I wanted. Other mediums such as Wordpress had similar issues. With no place
            to host my site for free with those properties, I put the idea aside.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't until I began working on a silly side project--
            it's actually listed on this site right
            <a href="https://mluzarow.github.io/WebGraphingCalc">here</a>-- consisting chiefly
            of a Javascript duplicate of the TI-84 Silver Ed. graphing calculator. I initially
            wanted to offer a
            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/js-graphing-calculator/6520040224325632">cool project</a>
            that kids could "spinoff" from on Khan Academy. It grew until it was too much of a pain
            to hold in the single file Khan Academy offered for each project, so I ended up moving
            it to my Github. It was then that I discovered
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>,
            something you should absolutely look into if you have no heard of it, and this site
            was born.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since then, I've been adding to the site, little by
            little, expanding what it offers. It is more-so just my internet portfolio than anything
            else. Hope you like it; I think the design worked out quite well.
