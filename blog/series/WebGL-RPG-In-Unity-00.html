            Introduction
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really enjoy making games. If you are reading this, I'm sure
            that at some point in your programming career --of whatever length it may be-- you had made some
            sort of console based game. Perhaps a number guessing game? Maybe something more complex like
            a choose your own adventure RPG! Whatever your poison, I too enjoyed the art of the text game.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, however, you begin to hunger for bigger and better things.
            You begin to yearn for graphics. Big and shiny colors and lights to add pizazz to your world. I had
            gone through a great many different mediums via which to implement this: GameMaker, XNA, Unity,
            etc. Each differed greatly in complexity and usefulness, but each got me a little bit closer to
            my goal of making an actual finished playable game.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, making a standalone game is one thing but being able to put your
            game online for everyone to play instantly with no hassle... Now that was attractive. Previously,
            there was no simple way to do this. You could make a Flash game but then your would have to use Flash;
            how unfortunate. You could make a Java applet but then nobody would ever touch it. Not so long ago Unity
            Web games starting getting popular but with them being phased out, that option is gone as well. There is,
            though, still a shining light of hope. That is the Unity WebGL game.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why not try about make a fun, simply RPG for everyone to enjoy online
            with WebGL?

            What is WebGL?
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to start answering that question, we have to go back and ask another
            question: "What is OpenGL?"
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is just a simple blog about the development of a web game, I won't go
            into detail about OpenGL itself or the graphics pipeline. Rather, a simple overview. OpenGL stands for Open
            Graphics Library; you can think of it as a graphics drawing API, because that's what it is. When you attempt
            to draw something to the screen in any capacity, you must call forth the raging power of your video card. Doing
            that manually is kind of difficult though. Thus, some kind and possibly frustrated people in the past had
            created APIs for us which interact with system we are running on to help describe to the hardware how to handle
            the scene we wish to create.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have extrapolated from that the idea that WebGL is a version of OpenGL for
            web applications. You are correct! WebGL is a graphics API that renders through the fancy HTML5 canvas element,
            allowing you to make super fancy looking games all in a web browser. The best part is, Unity now supports this
            vector for games and allows you to built directly for it. That's what we will do. Because it's really cool.

            The Idea
        </div>
        <div class="comments_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is it exactly that we will be working towards? Well, I don't really know.
            It's a bit more adventurous that way, don't you think? There are, however, some general bounds for the gameplay
            we have to put down or we will never get anywhere.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's begin with movement and camera. We want to have a top down camera, making the game
            a 2D tile-based top down game. We will allow the player free movement, a bit like the Pokemon games; perhaps this will
            keep the player from feeling too boxed in (hehehe). What about the purpose; what is the plot? I think it would be fun
            to play as a healer, so let's do that. The gameplay will center around the offensive and defensive use of a variety
            of healing, buffing, and manipulation spells in order to overcome battles and change the world around you. A fairly
            generic item system would be nice as well. We will also need a pretty hefty dialogue system, so we'll add that to
            the checklist as well.
            </br>
            </br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a really fast and loose framework for our project down, let's start doodling.
